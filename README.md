# Taco Generator

A web app created by Lawrence Win for the ClickTime software development internship challenge

## How to use

The app is hosted on GitHub Pages. Just go to the link [here](https://lawrencewin.github.io/taco-generator/#/).

However, the online version does have limitations. Due to the limitations of hosting things on pages, cookies can't be set, and
the main way of saving taco generations doesn't exist.

To run the app offline, clone the repository to your computer with `git clone https://github.com/lawrencewin/taco-generator.git`.

Once you clone the repo, simply go into the main directory and in your command line, run `npm start`.
